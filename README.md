# DVSA Driving Test Centre Statistics & Map

https://drivingteststats.cjar.co.uk/

A tool to help learner drivers and instructors discover the reasons behind the varying pass rates of driving test centres in the UK.

The data powering this project comes from a Freedom Of Information request. It can be found, along with scripts to aggregate it, in my [dvsa_driving_test_data](https://github.com/JakeCracknell/dvsa_driving_test_data) repository.
